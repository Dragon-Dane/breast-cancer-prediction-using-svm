## BREAST CANCER PREDICTION USING SVM
  In this model, I am gonna use python sklearn dataset of breast cancer. This dataset has 596 instances and 30 features like mean radius, mean texture, mean parameter, mean smoothness etc. So we have to create a model so that we can predict if tumour is malignant (has the potential to be dangerous) or Benign (not dangerous to health). We will use SVM Classifier to solve this problem

## Libraries Used
  Numpy and Pandas for Data Analysis
  
  Pandas and Seaborn for Data Visualization
  
  Sklearn for model selection and evaluation
  
## Description
  Here I got 39% accuracy which is very worst so I used normalization to improve it.
  
  Finally it has 98% accuracy.
